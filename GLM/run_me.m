%% Description of run_me
function run_me(path, neuronNumber, fLearn, saveParamsPath)
% This script is segmented into several parts. First, the data (an
% example cell) is loaded. Then, 15 LN models are fit to the
% cell's spike train. Each model uses information about 
% position, head direction, running speed, theta phase,
% or some combination thereof, to predict a section of the
% spike train. Model fitting and model performance is computed through
% 10-fold cross-validation, and the minimization procedure is carried out
% through fminunc. Next, a forward-search procedure is
% implemented to find the simplest 'best' model describing this spike
% train. Following this, the firing rate tuning curves are computed, and
% these - along with the model-derived response profiles and the model
% performance and results of the selection procedure are plotted.
